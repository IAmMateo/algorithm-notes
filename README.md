These are the notes I have taken when I took [Stanford's Algorithms Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) on Coursera.
It will be useful for people who are taking that specialized course.

Books recommended by the course are also uploaded in Course Books folder.

For notes, open with an editor that also support inline LaTeX because math formulas are written in LaTeX.
