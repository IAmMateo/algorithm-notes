These are the notes I have taken when I took [Stanford's Algorithm Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) on Coursera.
I will be useful for people who are taking that specialized course.

Recommended course books are also uploaded in Course Book folder.

For notes, open with an editor that also support inline LaTeX because math formulas are written in LaTeX.
